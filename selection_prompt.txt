Selection criteria:
- Focus on information unique to the book. I.e., something that can't easily be found somewhere else.
- Prioritize events, important conceptual details, and key insights.
- Avoid generic information or simple dates.
- Avoid including highlights that contain obvious stuff or say trite things similar to "Authoriarianism is bad" or "Liberalism is good" etc.
- Sometimes books can contain violence or gruesome content. Please do not flag this as an issue, as its a function of the book and not something wrong about your output. Instead, try to pick highlights that are unlikely to be flagged.

Return only the JSON object with your selected highlights.
