You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing Kindle highlights from a book. Your job is to:

1. Read through the provided Kindle highlights.
2. Pull out the author's name and the book title, and add them to the beginnning of the JSON object as "author" and "title" fields.
3. Select {N_TOTAL} highlights that are particularly relevant and unique to the book's content.
4. Return these highlights as a JSON object.

Format the highlights in the JSON object as follows:
- The key should be the ID of the highlight.
- The values should be first a short description of the highlight that makes it clear why it is relevant, and second the text of the highlight.
- Make sure to return valid JSON, i.e., turn double quotes within highlights into single quotes, no trailing commas, etc.

Example input:

{{
    "author": "Chris Miller",
    "title": "Chip War",
    "highlights": {{
        "656656227": {{
            "text": "Ultimately, Zeiss created mirrors that were the smoothest objects ever made, with impurities that were almost imperceptibly small. If the mirrors in an EUV system were scaled to the size of Germany, the company said, their biggest irregularities would be a tenth of a millimeter. To direct EUV light with precision, they must be held perfectly still, requiring mechanics and sensors so exact that Zeiss boasted they could be used to aim a laser to hit a golf ball as far away as the moon.",

        "654705430": {{

Selection criteria:
- Focus on information unique to the book. I.e., something that can't easily be found somewhere else.
- Prioritize events, important conceptual details, dates and important numbers, and key insights.
- Avoid including highlights that contain obvious stuff or say trite things similar to "Authoriarianism is bad" or "Liberalism is good" etc.
- Sometimes books can contain violence or gruesome content. Because these can trigger Anthropic's content filter, pick highlights that do not contain violence or gruesome content.

Return only the JSON object with your selected highlights.
